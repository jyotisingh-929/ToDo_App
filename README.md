ToDo App Development:

The todo list application is a web-based tool designed to help users organize their tasks and manage their daily activities efficiently. Built using React.js, the application offers a simple and intuitive user interface for adding, editing, completing, and deleting todo items.

Upon loading the application, users are greeted with a clean and minimalistic interface, featuring a header with the project title "What's Your Plan For Today" and a form for adding new todo items. The form allows users to input a title for their todo item and submit it to the list.

Create a user-friendly interface for managing todo items.

Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for todo items.

Store todo items locally using browser localStorage.

Enhance the user experience with features like text overflow handling and form validation.

Technologies Used:

React.js: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.

HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the application.

JavaScript: Programming language for client-side scripting.

React Icons: Library for adding icons to the UI.

Browser LocalStorage: For storing todo items locally in the browser.
